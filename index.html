            <h2>Personal Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                I am a third year Bachelor of Technology Automation Engineering student at McMaster University with a passion for applying engineering concepts to real world challenges. I am currently seeking opportunities to gain further industry experience, particularly in dynamic, team oriented environments that emphasize innovation and problem solving.
            </p>
            <p>
                My education and professional experiences have provided me with a strong foundation in automation, CAD design, 3D printing, and systems integration. During my exchange semester at Lund University in Sweden, I collaborated with international peers in interdisciplinary projects, expanding my professional network and gaining insights into diverse engineering practices.
            </p>
            <p>
                Previously, I worked as a Research Assistant at the Learning Factory at McMaster University, where I contributed to automation research, led equipment demonstrations, and designed RC car components featuring CANbus and Wireless Serial systems. My time at the City of Hamilton and Revera Retirement Home further honed my interpersonal skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am drawn to roles that allow me to leverage my technical expertise, adaptability, and teamwork to solve complex engineering challenges. I take pride in my ability to thrive in fast paced environments, quickly learn new technologies, and contribute to impactful projects.
